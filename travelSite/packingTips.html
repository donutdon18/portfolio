					The first thing you want to always have is a backpack. Personally, I like to use the backpack
					 for the travels. No big suitcase but a good size backpack. If you would like to bring a suitcase,
					  you can still bring a backpack to carry smaller items with you while you travel.

					<p>
					The next thing you always need is money. Not only do you need money for food, travels, and souvenirs 
					on your travels, but you need money just in case of emergencies. For example, you can forget your toothbrush
					 so you can buy a new one if needed.

					<p>
					Clothes are the last main things to bring. You may say that clothes are a given but I'm just listing out the 
					main neccesities for surviving a trip. You can buy clothes where you're going but imagine going outside in either the cold
					 or hot trying to buy appropriate clothes for travels.
