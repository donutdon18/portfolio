				<p>
					August 19th is National Honey Bee Day, so to help celebrate, NRCS wanted to 
					share an easy way to help bees: building a water garden!
				</p>
				<p>
					Bees, like people, need water to live. They use it to make honey and to keep 
					their hive cool in the summer. Bees are very small and can easily drown, so 
					they need shallow water to drink from. Shallow water can be hard to find, 
					especially in urban areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					NRCS works with farmers to help bees and other pollinators. Farmers are dependent 
					on pollinators to help their crops and so spend a lot of time making sure that 
					water is clean and pollinators are healthy. You can learn more about how farmers 
					help pollinators <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/farmers/?cid=nrcsdev11_001101">here.</a>

				<h3>Materials</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Rocks</li>
					<li>A wide shallow bowl or tub</li>
					<li>Water</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>1. Prepare the rocks</h3>
				<p>
					You can collect rocks from anywhere! Before putting them in the bowl, you should 
					wash the rocks using vinegar or a mild soap. Rinse well.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>2. Prepare the bowl</h3>
				<p>
					Arrange the rocks in a wide shallow bowl. Fill the bowl with enough water to 
					partially cover the rocks – the bees need dry rock to stand on.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>3. Place the bowl</h3>
				<p>
					If you’ve seen bees in your yard, you already know where to put the bowl! Otherwise, 
					put the bowl in a shaded location near where bees might go, like near flowers.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>4. Maintain the bowl</h3>
				<p>
					Check on the bowl regularly to make sure it has the right amount of water. If the 
					bowl overflows, pour some out so the bees can land. If it runs low, just add some more water.
				</p>
				<p>
					No need to clean the rocks, the bees won’t mind.
